# Dog_Collar_GeoFencing_application

Geofencing is a location-based service in which an app or other software utilizes GPS, RFID,
Wi-Fi or cellular data to activate a pre-programmed action when a mobile device or RFID tag
enters or departs a virtual border set up around a geographical place, known as a geofence.
Depending on how a geofence is set up, it can prompt mobile push notifications, trigger SMS
messages or alerts, send targeted social media advertisements, track vehicle fleets, deactivate
particular technology, or offer location-based marketing data. Some geofences are set up to
monitor activity in secure regions, allowing management to receive warnings whenever
someone enters or exits a specific region.
